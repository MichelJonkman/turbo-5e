- When you use a [healer's kit](https://5etools.com/items.html#healer's%20kit_phb) to heal a creature, that creature can add it's **Constitution modifier** to the number of regained **hit points**.
- With enough materials you can fashion a makeshift **healer's kit**, this kit can only be used by someone with this feat but using it does not benefit from this feat's other features.
- As part of a short rest you can forgo using any hit dice yourself and instead focus on healing others. Choose a number of creatures equal to **4 + your proficiency bonus** that spend one or more **Hit Dice**, at the end of the short rest these creatures regain an additional **1d8** **hit points**.
