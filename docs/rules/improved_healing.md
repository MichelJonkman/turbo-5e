# Improved healing
Healing in D&D 5e is often disappointing and rarely more useful than dealing damage, these rules buff healing in a way that allows players to heal more using their **Hit Dice** as a resource.

### Healer
_Feat_  
You are an able physician, allowing you to mend wounds quickly and get your allies back in the fight. You gain the following benefits:
- When you use a **healer's kit** to stabilize a dying creature, that creature also regains **1** **hit point**.
- When you use a **healer's kit** to heal a creature, that creature can add it's **Constitution modifier** to the number of regained **hit points**.
- With enough materials you can fashion a makeshift **healer's kit**, this kit can only be used by someone with this feat but using it does not benefit from this feat's other features.
- As part of a short rest you can forgo using any hit dice yourself and instead focus on healing others. Choose a number of creatures equal to **4 + your proficiency bonus** that expend one or more **Hit Dice**, at the end of the short rest these creatures regain an additional **1d8** **hit points**.
###### _Maybe for more points if using skill trees_ 
When you use a **healer's kit** to heal a creature, that creature can also add your proficiency modifier to the number of regained hit points.
