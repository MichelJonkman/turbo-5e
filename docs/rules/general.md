# Additional Rules

### Improved Actions
Instead of the normal actions, bonus actions and item interactions; a more flexible system is used, similar to how Pathfinder 2e works.

### Improved Healing

Healing in D&D 5e is often disappointing and rarely more useful than dealing damage, these rules buff healing in a way that allows players to heal more using their <b>Hit Dice</b> as a resource.

### Better Death Saves
Death saving throws no longer track failures and successes seperately. Instead, you start at 1 failed save and die at 4 failed saves. A successful death saving throw *reduces* the amount of failed saves by one. When the number reaches 0, you stabilize. Subsequently, you gain a "wound", after falling unconscious again all current wounds are added to the amount of failed saves.

Finishing a short or long rest with full health removes all wounds.

***
### Spell Slinging
You're allowed to cast other spells on the same turn when you cast a bonus action except when that bonus action spell used quickened spell, then you can't cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.

***
### Delay Initiative
You wait for the right moment to act. The rest of your turn doesn't happen yet. Instead, you're removed from the initiative order. You can return to the initiative order at the end of any other creature's turn. This permanently changes your initiative to the new position. You can't use reactions until you return to the initiative order. If you Delay an entire round without returning to the initiative order, the actions from the Delayed turn are lost, your initiative doesn't change, and your next turn occurs at your original position in the initiative order.

When you Delay, any persistent damage or other negative effects that normally occur at the start or end of your turn occur immediately when you use the Delay action. Any beneficial effects that would end at any point during your turn also end. The DM might determine that other effects end when you Delay as well. Essentially, you can't Delay to avoid negative consequences that would happen on your turn or to extend beneficial effects that would end on your turn.

***
### Proficiency Attunement Slots
Your amount of attunement slots is equal to your proficiency modifier.

##### _Future idea_
Double attunement slots and make attunement to certain items take more slots depending on the item. For example, a common item that requires attunement could cost 1 slot but a flame tongue could cost 2 slots. A staff of power could take 3 or more slots.

***
### Granular Milestones
Instead of milestone levelling being a single point where the DM decides whether you level up, a single level is divided into 3 points where the DM may decide to give more than 1 point depending on the achievement.

***

### Critical success and failure
When you roll for an ability check or saving throw, sometimes effects will be different based on the difference between the roll and the DC.

**Critical Success** Rolled a natural 20 or 5 over the DC.  
**Success** Rolled the DC or higher.  
**Failure** Rolled below the DC.  
**Critical Failure** Rolled a natural 1 or 10 below the DC.

If a natural 1 is rolled but the total roll is still above the DC, it counts as a success.
