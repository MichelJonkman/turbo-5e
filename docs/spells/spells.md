These effects can be mixed, for example: A 7th level spell slot would allow you to target 2 large creatures and a small
creature

### Wall of Force

_5th-level evocation_  
**Casting Time**: 1 action  
**Range**: 120 feet  
**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)  
**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minutes

An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any
orientation you choose. It can attach to any solid surface larger than itself and has almost no weight.
You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet,
or you can shape a single plane made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels in the same orientation.
Each panel must be adjacent to another panel.

In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick and lasts for the duration.
If the wall cuts through an object or creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall
(your choice which side).

The wall only allows light to pass through, blocking everything else including spells. It is resistant to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage;
and vulnerable to force damage.
The wall has an AC of 16 and when it receives an attack of at least 20 damage or is dispelled by Dispel Magic,
the caster must make a saving throw using the ability score that was used to cast the spell.
The DC equals 9 + (DMG / 20) rounded down. On a failed save the wall disappears.
A disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly.
The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.

**At Higher Levels.** When you upcast this spell, the maximum duration increases by 1 minute per extra level.
