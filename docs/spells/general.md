- Earthbind buff, longer duration and no feather falling not crit fail
- Create a spell variant system, allowing for slightly different variations of the same spell

**Critical Success** Rolled a natural 20 or 5 over the DC.  
**Success** Rolled the DC or higher.  
**Failure** Rolled below the DC.  
**Critical Failure** Rolled a natural 1 or 10 below the DC.

If a natural 1 is rolled but the total roll is still above the DC, it counts as a success.

### Spell variants

Some spells might have variants, small deviations from the original spell that might be more powerful or provide an
extra niche use-case.

When you choose to learn a spell with variants, you can opt to learn a variant instead.
Learning variants of the same spell is easier than learning new spells, as such your DM might allow you to learn new
variants from NPCs or items in the world without extra cost.
Because variants are slight modifications to the same spell, you can freely choose which variant to cast when casting
without having to prepare them separately.
