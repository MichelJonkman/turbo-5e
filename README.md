A compendium of homebrew rules to enhance the D&D 5e experience.

  <summary><b>Improved healing</b></summary>
  
Healing in D&D 5e is often disappointing and rarely more useful than dealing damage, these rules buff healing in a way that allows players to heal more using their <b>Hit Dice</b> as a resource.

  <summary><b>Better death saves</b></summary>
  
Death saving throws no longer track failures and successes seperately. Instead, you start at 1 failed save and die at 4 failed saves. A successful death saving throw *reduces* the amount of failed saves by one. When the number reaches 0, you stabilize. Subsequently, you gain a "wound", after falling unconscious again all current wounds are added to the amount of failed saves.

Finishing a short or long rest with full health removes all wounds.

  <summary><b>Spell slinging</b></summary>
  
You're allowed to cast other spells on the same turn when you cast a bonus action except when that bonus action spell used quickened spell, then you can't cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Delay initiative</b></summary>
  
Right before you take you turn you can choose to instead delay it until another creature has taken it's turn. When you choose to delay, specify the condition after which you want to take your turn, if your condition hasn't happened at the end of the round: you lose your turn. If the condition is triggered during another creature's turn, you have to wait until it has finished.

<details>
  <summary><b>Proficiency attunement slots</b></summary>
  
Your amount of attunement slots is equal to your proficiency modifier.

<h5><i>Future idea</i></h5>
Double attunement slots and make attunement to certain items take more slots depending on the item. For example, a common item that requires attunement could cost 1 slot but a flame tongue could cost 2 slots. A staff of power could take 3 or more slots.

<details>
  <summary><b>Granular milestones</b></summary>
  
Instead of milestone levelling being a single point where the DM decides whether you level up, a single level is divided into 3 points where the DM may decide to give more than 1 point depending on the achievement.
