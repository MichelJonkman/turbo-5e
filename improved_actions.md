# Improved actions
Instead of the normal actions, bonus actions and item interactions; a more flexible system is used, similar to how Pathfinder 2e works.

You get 3 actions, where anything that would normally cost an action now costs 2 actions and anything that would normally cost a bonus action now costs 1 action. Additionally, an action can be downgraded to an item interaction if needed.

If for any reason you would normally lose the ability to use your action, you instead lose 2 actions and the same for a bonus action.
## Balancing changes
### Bonus action spells
A spell with a cast time of a bonus action (now 1 action) can only be cast once per turn.
### Metamagic: Quickened spell
This option can only be used once per turn to prevent being able to cast 3 action spells in a single turn.
