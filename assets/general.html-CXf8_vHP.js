Learning variants of the same spell is easier than learning new spells, as such your DM might allow you to learn new
variants from NPCs or items in the world without extra cost.
Because variants are slight modifications to the same spell, you can freely choose which variant to cast when casting
without having to prepare them separately.</p>`,15)]))}const c=a(i,[["render",s],["__file","general.html.vue"]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/spells/general.html","title":"Spell Changes And Additions","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"next":"spells"},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Rebalancing","slug":"rebalancing","link":"#rebalancing","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Spell variants","slug":"spell-variants","link":"#spell-variants","children":[]}]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1730224599000,"contributors":[{"name":"Michel","email":"mj.99@live.nl","commits":1},{"name":"Michel Jonkman","email":"git@micheljonkman.nl","commits":1}]},"filePathRelative":"spells/general.md"}');export{c as comp,h as data};
